Hello and thank you for taking the time to read the README.md file for my dashboard project.

This project will be a practice using css grid as much as possible. There will be a couple of elements that use flexbox, but the majority of this project should be done through css grid. I will also try and be using some of the inheritance selectors that I have learned through The Odin Project, as well as some additional advanced css techniques that should make my website building journey a smoother one. This project will not be implementing forms and requests, but perhaps in the future I may add form functionality.

After this project is complete, it should look like the image in the dashboard project design png file located in the images file. Thanks again for reading and I hope this project can showcase what I have learned about css grid.
