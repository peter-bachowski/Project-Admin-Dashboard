Hello and thank you for taking the time to read the README.md file for my dashboard project.

This project will be a practice using css grid as much as possible. There will be a couple of elements that use flexbox, but the vast majority of this project will be done through css grid. I will also try and be using some of the inheritance selectors that I have learned through The Odin Project, as well as some additional advanced css techniques that should make my website building journey a smoother one.

After this project is complete, it should look like the image in the dashboard project design png file located in the images file. Thanks again for reading and I hope this project can showcase what I have learned about css grid.
